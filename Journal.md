# Part 1: The Game
12.31.2025: 
I got a basic stage set up with some player movement. I spent too much time trying to get my player to be a rigidbody when there was a template with all the movement using CharacterBody2d :(

1.4.2026: 
Lots of progress was made today!
First, now the player can fire projectiles left and right. Secondly, a basic rolling enemy has been added. For the enemy and for the player a health system has been added. The player and the enemy both can die as a result of either the enemy colliding into the player or the player shooting enough projectiles at the enemy.
Todo:
    enemy spawner,
    Wave system,
    Time survived system,
    More enemy types,
    Platforms that are added as more enemies are killed,
